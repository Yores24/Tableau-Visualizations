## Tableau Visualizations Repository
Welcome to the Tableau Visualizations Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing various visualizations created using Tableau. Feel free to explore the different dashboards and visualizations available here.

Getting Started
To get started, simply navigate through the repository to find the Tableau workbooks (.twb) or Tableau packaged workbooks (.twbx) you're interested in. You can view these visualizations directly on Tableau Public or download the workbook files to explore them further using Tableau Desktop.
